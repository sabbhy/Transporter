File transfer is a very important part of anyone using a computer. Itâ€™s
important to transfer files to share data and other resources. The use
of external devices for transferring files makes the task slightly
tedious. Thus, arose the era of wireless transfer.
The project File Transfer is designed to copy files from one computer
to another using the powerful Java language. RMI is used to establish
connection between the two systems. File pointers are used to point
to the required files and a byte object is used to move the data byte
by byte. The application is more than two hundred times faster than
applications using Bluetooth for transfer.
